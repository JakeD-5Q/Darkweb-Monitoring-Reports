''' Create a connection/database store information into a table using the entry fields as column names. Keep track of entries that already exist (compare ID values) '''
# I may put idea values into list (LIST(SELECT ID FROM DEHASHED))
# get data into dataframe, then select it into a list for i in new, if i is not in old then + to new_list
# unless there is a way to 'update table' but if exists push to stack ???
